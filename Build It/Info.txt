If you are reading this, you have found the updated version of this software. Hurrah!
I made some changes following my email, so I've left this update here in hopes you would find it.

These changes mostly just contains an audio system integrated into the game.
All audio has been solely developed by myself, so feel free to include (or not include) it within your video!
